# Basic Recipe website

This is a simple website containing basic recipies of my favorite dishes. I started this as part of frontend learning journey in The ODIN Project.
I added my own twist by selecting my favorite foods from a restaurant I love, Which is FAM Roast N' Roll.
I am starting this with just html basics and throughout time I hope to improve the website with better style and functionality.
